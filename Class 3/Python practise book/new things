The sort method works even when the list has different types of objects and even lists.We can optionally specify a function as sort key like in sorted.
Since parenthesis are also used for grouping, tuples with a single value are represented with an additional comma.


A module is imported using the import statement.

>>> import time
>>> print time.asctime()
'Fri Mar 30 12:59:21 2012'

There is also another way to use the import statement.

>>> from time import asctime
>>> asctime()
'Fri Mar 30 13:01:37 2012'




The zipfile module provides interface to read and write zip files.

Here are some examples to demonstate the power of zipfile module.

The following example prints names of all the files in a zip archive.

import zipfile
z = zipfile.ZipFile("a.zip")
for name in z.namelist():
    print name

The try statement can have an optional else clause, which is executed only if no exception is raised in the try-block.

There can be an optional else clause with a try statement, which is executed irrespective of whether or not exception has occured.
Exception is raised using the raised keyword.





The built-in function iter takes an iterable object and returns an iterator.

The __iter__ method is what makes an object iterable. Behind the scenes, the iter function calls __iter__ method on the given object.The return value of __iter__ is an iterator. It should have a next method and raise StopIteration when there are no more elements.




Yield is a keyword that is used like return, except the function will return a generator.When next` method is called for the first time, the function starts executing until it reaches yield statement. The yielded value is returned by the next call.

************************************************************








a={1,2,3}
type of a is set
a={}  > null dict

a={ x*x for x in range(5)}   set comprehension
a={x:x+1 for x in range(10)} dict comprehension

The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action.

even functions without a return statement do return a value, albeit a rather boring one. This value is called None


The default values are evaluated at the point of function definition in the defining scope, so that
i = 5

def f(arg=i):
    print arg

i = 6
f()



>>> range(3, 6)             # normal call with separate arguments
[3, 4, 5]
>>> args = [3, 6]
>>> range(*args)            # call with arguments unpacked from a list
[3, 4, 5]

In the same fashion, dictionaries can deliver keyword arguments with the **-operator:
>>>

>>> def parrot(voltage, state='a stiff', action='voom'):
...     print "-- This parrot wouldn't", action,
...     print "if you put", voltage, "volts through it.",
...     print "E's", state, "!"
...
>>> d = {"voltage": "four million", "state": "bleedin' demised", "action": "VOOM"}
>>> parrot(**d)
-- This parrot wouldn't VOOM if you put four million volts through it. E's bleedin' demised !
